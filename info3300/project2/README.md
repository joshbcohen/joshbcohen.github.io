info3300- Project 2
===================
A dynamic visualization project for Data-Driven Web Applications in Spring 2014 at Cornell University, built by Joshua Cohen, Jie Lin, and Christian Compton.

The vizualation uses d3.js to map energy usage in the United States. The user can view information on energy usage from different sources of energy by state and nationally, and can see how energy usage changes from year to year. The default view shows the primary energy source for each state, and clicking on an energy source in the legend yields a cloropleth view for that energy source, allowing users to see how that specific energy source compares from state to state.
