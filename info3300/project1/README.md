========
A static vizualization project for Data-Driven Web Applications in Spring 2014 at Cornell University, built by Joshua Cohen, Erik Bonadonna and Christian Compton.

The vizualation uses d3.js to map marine pollution incidents reported to or investigated by the Coast Gaurd in and around the United States. 

The map uses translucent circles to represent spills, allowing the user to see where spills were concentrated most heavily.
